    const backgroudInfo = `Hi, my name is Ajit, I am a Software Developer. ðŸ’¯ My primary focus is to build Full Stack Applications with REST APIs, Integration, Javascript skills, and NextJs/ReactJs web applications. My skillsets include Javascript, Java, Python, SQL, C++, and frameworks such as NextJs, ReactJS, NodeJS, Angular, and Shopify. I do this because I love helping businesses showcase their full potential to the customer through software solutions. Also, I just love the process of software development, whereby you can take something from an idea to a real product that many can use. ðŸŒŸ Over the years, I have started to become very versed in things like architecture design and communication. On a side note, I also love drawing or painting stuff and have been doing it since I was young. It is something that allows me to be creative, connect with people, and even just bring people together through teaching.`
